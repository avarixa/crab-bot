# **CRAB BOT**
## MADE BY XC ENRIQUEZ 2020

#### How To Use:

###### Step Zero - Inviting the Bot
If this bot is not yet in the server you wish to use it on, personally contact me for an invite link.

###### Step One - The Discord Bot Token
You will need a Discord bot token. Personally contact me (Siren#9889) for the bot's token and paste it on the last line of `crab.py.`

If the token is ABC123, the last line of `crab.py` **must** be
```
crab.run("ABC123")
```

###### Step Two - Preparing the files
Place all buddy profiles in image forms inside the `Buddy_Profiles` folder. 
Make a `.csv` file containing the **Buddy Nickname** on the **first column** and the **Buddy Profile Filename** on the **second column**. Note that the nicknames on the first column will be used to invoke the bidding. 
**FILENAMES ARE CASE-SENSITIVE** make sure the filename is **exact**

#### You're done!
More bullets will follow, but they are all optional.

###### "What does this do?"
Function descriptions are commented inside the `.py` file.

###### Changing the bot responses
Changing what is inside the .send() functions will change the bot responses. Refer to the `.py` for more details.

###### Unfinished Functions and Calls
There are unfinished functions and calls in the file. Feel free to finish them. Documentation can be found in https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
